# SOLANGE ART STUDIOS
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/cyVoI0Qng2k
### Brief Description:
>This is the Final Project for **CS50's Introduction to Computer Science**. For that, I've made a Website for my mother's art studio. 
>She always wanted to have her Website to show her work to the world, and in the future, sell it. You can check it out in the URL above.

## Languages, Libraries, and Frameworks Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Font-Awesome
- Google Fonts
- BootStrap
- VOV.CSS

### Index Features:
- In this Website, I used the header and the footer on the left side of the screen (also called aside).
- The main header photo is also a link to the index page. I used the border-radius to make it a circle. It also has a box shadow effect.
- The main title uses the Google Fonts called "Sofia".
- The main title also uses the VOV.CSS library for the blur-in effect, but only on the index page.
- I used the Font-Awesome Instagram Symbol
- If you hover the mouse pointer on the Instagram symbol, it will light up.
- If you click on the same button, you will be redirected to her Instagram on a new tab.
- The footer has a Copyright tag from Font-Awesome.
- In the body, we have the first button "Check it out! that is anchored to the "portfolio part of the page.
- Next, we have the "Recent Works" that shows a carousel with the indicators and left/right buttons. I utilized the BootStrap frameworks to do so. There is also a button for the full portfolio.
- Below it, I've made a simple "About" part with three paragraphs of simple text.
- Then we had the "Portfolio". There are four photos with links there. Those photos also use the Google Font "Sofia". They have the same box shadow as the header photo. When we hover the mouse on a photo, it transforms with a zoom effect.
- At the bottom of the page, I did a "Get in Touch" with a form for Name, Email Address, and Message. It also has a "Send button". This form utilizes the "mailto" value to "action" and a POST method.
- The background-color is gradient from blue to orange in 45 degrees.

### Earings, Necklaces Bracelets, and Bundles Features:
- All four pages have the same concept. The header and footer are the same as the index, except that the main title doesn't use the VOV.CSS.
- I used the CSS Flexbox to do the photo grid.
- There is a Border Radius on every photo, just to take out some of the roughness.
- I've made a modal window with JavaScript that open a larger photo. To close, there is a button on the top-right portion of the screen, or we can use the "ESC" button on the keyboard.


### Future Improvements:
- Make a BackEnd part of the website.
- Implement a shopping cart and a shop on the website.
- Allow the user to make an account, with the option to receive a monthly newsletter.
- Media port for different screen sizes. Right now, it only works properly on web browsers.
